I&#8217;m an IT student, software engineer and hobby game developer.

My current passion is my game project &#8220;Fucking 50 DKP Minus: Raiders of the Lost Content&#8221; (title WIP). It&#8217;s a hero-unit focused RTS game set in the world of a fantasy MMORPG (the game&#8217;s single player though). You play a hardcore progress raid guild that has exhausted the entirety of the raid content! So you start raiding other universes and the never ending search for new &#8220;world-first kill&#8221; achievements.

If you need some comparisons: RTS control like in StarCraft2, focus on heros & abilities like MOBAs and multi-stage bossfights like your favorite MMORPG! &#8230;and of course an abundance of pointless achievements like in every <del datetime="2017-09-23T18:26:41+00:00">good</del> game!
