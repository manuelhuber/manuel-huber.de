I&#8217;ve decided to write about my game dev experience on my first game &#8220;Fucking 50 DKP Minus: Raiders of the Lost Content&#8221; (orÂ **DKP** for short &#8211; title still WIP)Â to keep me honest & stay on track and to have a nice memory when I want to look back on that time that I made that one game. I&#8217;m planning on doing a Recap every 2 weeks and describe what progress I made. To keep my tasks and progress in order I started a <a href="http://trello.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trello</a> board &#8211; i guess hours of agile training do leave a mark&#8230; ðŸ˜€

### Gameplay

What&#8217;s the game? It&#8217;s an RTS focused on a small amount of units (5-10) with special abilities fighting interesting enemies, mainly bosses. There was a period where I was in a progress raid guild in WoW and the worst thing about raiding was watching people die in the fire. It&#8217;s a giant red thing on the ground &#8211; move away you idiot! So I thought: How about a game where you raid, but you control EVERYBODY. Of course you&#8217;d have to cut quite a bit but that&#8217;s the main idea. It&#8217;s probably going to end up feeling like a mix between the StarCraft 2 single player (the hero missions) and a MOBA but I want the boss fights to have a lot of unique mechanics. I&#8217;m gonna build it with unity because of it&#8217;s a very popular engine and there&#8217;s huge amounts of tutorials etc.
  
I have a lot of ideas for features like customization, leveling, skill trees, items, spell upgrades, a whole raid-guild-management layer on top of the normal gameplay, even multiplayer, &#8230; But that&#8217;s way in the future. Like &#8220;not even thinking about it&#8221; in the future. First I need a **prototype**. Maybe it turns out the gameplay isn&#8217;t fun and I should scrap the idea. So what&#8217;s the goal? **5 Heroes with each 4 unique abilities fighting 1 boss.Â **I feel like that&#8217;s reasonable to achieve (especially considering my rate of progress so far without any Unity experience).

### Story

I&#8217;m not a story guy &#8211; I usually skip cut scenes. So don&#8217;t expect an amazing plot with twists and turns. The idea is: You are playing as an entire progress raid guild. You work hard to get world first kills. And like any hardcore MMORPG player out there, you **run out of content** very fast. So your guild starts raiding other universes. That&#8217;s basically my cheap story to allow me to make a lot of disconnected boss fights where the art styles don&#8217;t match. You can fight aliens in a realistic sci-fi setting and dragons in a cartoon fantasy world. The main reason is that I need to rely on the unity asset store for art. I bought the character models and some spell effects and I expect to spend more money so I&#8217;d love to be able to use as many free assets as possible. It also forces me to be creative and allow me to get crazy with the boss fights.

I&#8217;ll post a &#8220;State of the Game&#8221; soo &#8211; it&#8217;s one of my tasks for this sprint (which ends on the 8th of october). Besides the recaps I might post a few tutorials or How-Tos when I make something that I feel is worth writing down.
